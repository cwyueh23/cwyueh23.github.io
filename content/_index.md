## About Me

I am an incoming PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Southern California. My research interest lies broadly in optimization, control, and learning theory. Particularly, I work on analysis of reinforcement learning algorithms. 

Previously, I received my B.S. degree in electrical engineering and mathematics from National Taiwan University (NTU). During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Pei-Yuan Wu at NTU, Dr. Wen-Liang Hwang at Academia Sinica, and Prof. Jr-Shin Li at Washington University in St. Louis.
